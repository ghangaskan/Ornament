Christmas ornament LED chaser from NE555P and CD4017BE

If this works when it comes back from fab, it should be a LED chaser down both sides of the tree.

I didn't give it a power source, so I should do that. I was figuring I would just power it directly from a 5v transformer to one of the shared GND and VCC pins. I may get back to it soon to resolve.
Or...
I may also be reworking another ornament using a CH32v003 instead of the more expensive 555.

The combination of SMD and through hole parts correlates to stuff I have laying around.
